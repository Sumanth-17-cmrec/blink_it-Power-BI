# blink_it-Power-BI
This GitHub repository showcases a personal Power BI project developed to analyze sales data from Blinkit, India's premier quick commerce platform that delivers groceries and essentials in under 10 minutes. 
Originally launched as Grofers in 2013, Blinkit pivoted to hyperlocal delivery in 2021, now operating over 500 dark stores in 30+ cities and serving 10 million monthly users with a focus on urban convenience. The dashboard, built from a decade-spanning dataset of 17,046 items, visualizes key performance indicators like total sales of 2.40 million, average order value of 141, and an overall item rating of 3.9, providing deep insights into operational efficiency and consumer trends.

Inspired by real-world quick commerce challenges, the project assumes a proprietary sales ledger as the core data source, cleaned and modeled using Power Query for accuracy. It highlights Blinkit's growth trajectory post-Zomato acquisition in 2022, where the platform captured over 50% market share by optimizing inventory turnover and last-mile logistics. Visuals break down revenue by categories, showing fruits leading at 0.36 million in sales, followed by snacks (0.35 million) and household items (0.27 million), while low-fat products account for 71.3% of dairy preferences, indicating a shift toward healthier options.​​

The dashboard features slicers for filtering by outlet size (small, medium, high), location tiers (1-3), and establishment years (2012-2022), allowing users to explore trends dynamically. Bar charts compare outlet types, with Supermarket Type1 generating 1.58 million in sales from 11,154 items at an average of 141, outperforming grocery stores (303.88K from 2,166 items) in volume but matching in ratings of 4.0. Pie charts and maps reveal geographic hotspots, such as Tier 3 cities driving 944.27K in revenue, underscoring expansion potential in semi-urban areas.​​

Line graphs track sales growth against outlet proliferation, while gauge visuals spotlight high-rated categories like meat and canned goods at 4.0. Additional DAX measures calculate KPIs such as item visibility (0.10 average for grocery stores) and fat content distribution, enabling scenario analysis for stock optimization. Frozen foods (0.24 million), dairy (0.20 million), and baking supplies (0.16 million) emerge as top performers, with Tier 2 contributing 786.30K overall.​​

From this analysis, patterns suggest prioritizing snacks and low-fat dairy in medium-sized outlets for impulse-driven quick commerce, aligning with Blinkit's 8-15% commission model on high-frequency orders. Supermarkets excel in diverse assortments, but smaller stores offer better visibility for niche items, informing targeted promotions. The project assumes ETL processes via SQL for data ingestion, followed by Power BI modeling with star schemas for relationships between sales, items, and outlets.​​

As a hands-on endeavor, the repo includes the PBIX file, sample queries, and notes on building interactive reports, ideal for replicating in e-commerce analytics. It demonstrates how such tools can forecast demand, reduce waste, and boost margins in competitive markets like India's quick commerce boom.
